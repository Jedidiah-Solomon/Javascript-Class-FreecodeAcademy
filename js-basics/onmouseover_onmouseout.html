<h2>The onmouseover Event</h2>
<p>The onmouseover event occurs when the mouse pointer enters an element.

The onmouseover event is often used together with the onmouseout event, which occurs when the mouse pointer leaves the element.</p>

<img onmouseover="bigImg(this)" onmouseout="normalImg(this)" border="0" src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley" width="32" height="32">

<p>The function bigImg() is triggered when the user moves the mouse pointer over the image.</p>
<p>The function normalImg() is triggered when the mouse pointer is moved out of the image.</p>

<script>
function bigImg(x) {
  x.style.height = "64px";
  x.style.width = "64px";
}

function normalImg(x) {
  x.style.height = "32px";
  x.style.width = "32px";
}
