<h2>Fetch a JSON file with XMLHttpRequest</h2>

const xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();

<!--
      In this code, you need to replace "your-username" with your GitHub username and "repo-name" with the name of your GitHub repository where you have hosted the "json_demo.txt" file.

      The URL specified in xmlhttp.open() is set to the raw content URL of the "json_demo.txt" file on GitHub. This URL provides direct access to the raw content of the file. Make sure the file is publicly accessible, or you have appropriate permissions to access it.

      When you open the HTML file in a web browser, it will fetch the "json_demo.txt" file from the specified GitHub URL using XMLHttpRequest and display the value of the name property within the <p> element with the id "demo".

      Please note that if your GitHub repository is private, you might need to authenticate or adjust the repository settings to allow public access to the raw file content.
