/*
This JavaScript code creates a pie chart using the Google Charts library. Here's a detailed explanation:

The first line declares a JavaScript block using the <script> tag with a type attribute of "text/javascript".
The second line calls the google.charts.load() function to load the Google Charts library. The function is passed two arguments: 'current' specifies the current version of the library, and {'packages':['corechart']} specifies that the 'corechart' package should be loaded.
The third line calls the google.charts.setOnLoadCallback() function to set a callback function to be called when the library has finished loading. The drawChart() function is passed as the callback function.
The drawChart() function is defined, which creates a new pie chart with the PieChart() constructor provided by the Google Charts library.
The google.visualization.arrayToDataTable() function is used to create a new DataTable object. This function is passed a two-dimensional array that represents the data for the pie chart. The first element of each row is a string representing the name of the activity, and the second element is a number representing the number of hours spent on that activity per day.
The options object is created to specify the title and dimensions of the chart.
A new PieChart object is created and passed the div element with the id of "piechart" where the chart will be displayed.
The chart.draw() method is called to display the chart in the <div> element with the specified data and options.
Overall, this code loads the Google Charts library and creates a pie chart that displays the distribution of different activities over an average day, including work, eating, TV, gym, and sleep.
